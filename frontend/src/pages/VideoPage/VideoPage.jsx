Wanted to change the setting, but I would have missed the beginning of the song.)\n\nAt Dave's book release event for \"The Storyteller\" (at the Ford-Los Angeles, October 12, 2021). I've seen him play this song on the drums once or twice over the years (like at Cal Jam), but usually with a guest singer. This is the first time I've seen him play along to the original track‚Äîwith Kurt's voice. What an emotional, funny, revealing, memorable night. Now gotta go read the book. \n\nFor those of you who have commented about how hard this must be for Dave...\n\nI agree... it probably wasn't easy for DG to get to this point where he was willing to share. At the show (and in his book and many interviews) he actually talked about the long path it took to get to not only TALK about Kurt, but to even want to listen to ANY music after his death. Still, a lot of time has passed, which always helps. And in the meantime, Dave has become quite a talented, thoughtful storyteller. I am sure, as difficult as it will always be to him, it probably also now a cathartic experience for him. At least I hope it is. \n\nMore from the show... https://youtu.be/spGIAyPM_ck\n\n(I posted photos and a little more video on my instagram‚Äî@bernstorm5000. There are many other shots of the Foos throughout my IG feed... and I also created the IG hashtag #album5000 for many of my rock shots.)\n\n\n#davegrohl #nirvana #smellsliketeenspirit #thefordla #foofighters #thestoryteller #drums",
